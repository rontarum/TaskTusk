### Issue 3: Fonts Not Loading on iOS Devices
**Problem:** Custom fonts (Gropled, Montserrat, Neutral Face) fall back to system fonts on iOS.
**Root Cause:** Fonts are referenced in CSS variables but never loaded:
- No `@font-face` declarations
- No Google Fonts imports for these fonts
- Fonts may work on desktop if installed locally

**Solution:**
- For Montserrat: Add Google Fonts import (available on Google Fonts)
- For Gropled: Either find a suitable alternative or host font files locally with @font-face
- For Neutral Face: Find alternative or local font file

### Issue 4: Button Hover State Stuck on Mobile (Card Form)
**Problem:** When opening the card creation/editing menu (bottom sheet/dialog), the "save" button enters a hover state. After animation, it breaks the shadow and a semi-transparent rectangular mask appears around the button. This shouldn't happen on mobile - there's no hover on touch devices.
**Root Cause:**
- Mobile browsers often simulate `:hover` on touch
- The button's hover styles persist after dialog/drawer animation completes
- The shadow breaks due to the stuck hover state creating visual artifacts

**Affected Components:**
- `PlannerItemForm` (mobile version in `MobileTaskForm.tsx`)
- `MobileTaskForm` save button
- Any save/submit buttons in mobile dialogs/drawers

**Solution:**
- Disable hover effects on touch devices using `@media (hover: none)`
- Add touch event handlers to explicitly clear hover states
- Use `transform: translateY()` instead of `top` for pressed offset (consistent with Issue 1)
